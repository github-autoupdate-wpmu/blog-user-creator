"Fill out the details below to easily create multiple users and blogs and add "
"yourself as admin to them (if you wish). <br /><br />You can create up to 15 "
"different users and blogs at one time and new users will be emailed their "
"usernames and passwords automatically. If you need more than 15 please "
"simply process this form and then start again.<br /><br /> Please try to use "
"unique usernames and blog URLs as this will make the process a lot quicker "
"for you. An easy way to do this is to add numbers and letters after a "
"regular name - for example 'James' at 'Kings Heath School' in year 10 could "
"be 'jameskh10'."
